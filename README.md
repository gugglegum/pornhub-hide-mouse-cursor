# PornHub hide mouse cursor

For some misunderstanding, PornHub does not automatically hide the mouse cursor on top of the playing video and this can be distracting. And although, of course, you can always move the cursor to the right side of the screen, where it is almost invisible, it would be more convenient if it disappeared automatically. This userscript hides the mouse cursor when watching videos on PornHub after 2 seconds of inactivity (like on YouTube).

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension (or a similar userscript manager) if you haven't already.
2. Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gugglegum/pornhub-hide-mouse-cursor/master/pornhub-hide-mouse-cursor.user.js) to install the script.

## Usage

The script will automatically hide the mouse cursor after 2 seconds of inactivity while watching a video on PornHub.
